# Emergency Social Network (ESN)

We call it Emergency Social Network, or ESN. The goal is to provide civilians with a social network that they can use during emergency situations. The system is different from other existing social networks because it is specifically designed to effectively support small communities of civilians seriously affected in case of natural disasters like earthquake, tsunami, tornado, wildfire, etc.

## Actors

This section lists the actors participating in a “user” view.

- **Citizen:** Anyone who uses the system to communicate with other citizens in case of an emergency.
  
- **Coordinator:** A person who plays a significant role in the community and has the authority to broadcast public messages. Examples include officials like city mayor, police chief, school principal, or campus director. Other examples include citizens who spontaneously demonstrate leadership during the incident and hence are empowered to be coordinators.
  
- **Administrator:** A person who administers the system. An example of administrative work involves providing users with the appropriate privilege level.
